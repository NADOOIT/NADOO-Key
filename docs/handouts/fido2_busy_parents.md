## What It Is
- A small security key that logs you in with a tap—no more password juggling.

## Why Use It
- Safer: prevents phishing and fake login sites.
- Simpler: no complex passwords to remember; no SMS codes.
- Portable: one key works across your devices.

## How It Works (Simple)
- The key stores your secrets safely.
- When a site asks you to log in, you tap the key; it confirms it’s really you.
- Your private keys never leave the device.

## Feels Good to Use
- Tap and done—like a car key for your digital life.
- Fewer interruptions when you’re busy.

## Saves Time
- No password resets or unlock calls.
- Faster logins at home and at work.

## Get Started (Linux)
```bash
sudo ./bin/nadoo-key provision
```
Defaults: new keys use PIN 0000; login is touch‑only by default. Fingerprint optional.

## Tips
- Keep a backup key in a safe place (e.g., with important documents).
- You can use the same key for web apps (passkeys) and local logins.

## FAQs
- What if I lose it? Use your backup key and register a replacement.
- Can my partner use the same key? Best practice: one key per person; each has their own.
