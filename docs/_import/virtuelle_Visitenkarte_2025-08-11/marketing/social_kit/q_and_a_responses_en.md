# Comment & Q&A Responses (EN)

Q: We already use MFA. Why switch?
A: Traditional MFA can be phished (push/OTP). FIDO2 is phishing‑resistant and faster (plug + touch).

Q: Is fingerprint required?
A: No. Default is touch‑only to avoid lockouts. Fingerprint can be enabled by policy.

Q: Will this work on macOS/Windows?
A: Yes for web apps (passkeys/WebAuthn). Linux OS login now; sudo on macOS; we track platform updates.

Q: What if someone loses a key?
A: Issue a backup key; revoke mapping; user continues with backup.

Q: Can we really do 500 in one day?
A: Yes, with multi‑station factory provisioning, CSV logging, and pre‑briefed waves.
