# Messaging Pillars

1) Phishing‑resistant by design
- No passwords/OTPs to phish. Origin‑bound credentials. Aligns with NIST/CISA guidance.

2) One‑touch user experience
- Plug + touch. Default touch‑only avoids biometric lockouts; fingerprint optional by policy.

3) One‑day rollout at scale
- Factory provisioning for up to 500 people/day with CSV logging and optional service registration.

4) Clear ROI
- Up to 80% fewer resets; faster onboarding; minimal recurring cost. Hardware at cost.

5) Complete toolkit
- CLI + docs + handouts for end‑users, managers, helpdesk (EN/DE).
