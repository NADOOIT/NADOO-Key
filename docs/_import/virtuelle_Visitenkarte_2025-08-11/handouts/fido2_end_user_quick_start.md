# FIDO2 Security Key – Quick Start (Employees)

Audience: All employees

Keep this with your badge.

## What you need
- Your FIDO2 security key (e.g., YubiKey)
- Your computer or work account
- Your organization may also give you a backup key

## How to log in (computer)
1) Plug in your key.
2) On the login or lock screen, touch the key when it blinks.
3) You are in. No password needed.

Notes:
- If your company enables fingerprint: touch the sensor when asked.
- If the key flashes red or asks for a PIN, follow “If something goes wrong”.

## How to approve admin actions (sudo/prompt)
- Touch the key when asked. If fingerprint is enabled for admin actions, use it.

## How to use it on websites
- When a website/app asks to “Use security key” or “Passkey”, select it and touch your key.

## If something goes wrong
- Red light / too many touches: unlock with your PIN when prompted, then try again.
- Computer doesn’t see the key: unplug and re‑plug; try a different USB port.
- Still stuck? Contact IT (see Support).

## If you lose your key
- Report it to IT immediately. Use your backup key if you have one.

## Privacy
- Your key stores secrets on the device; they are not shared with the company or websites.
