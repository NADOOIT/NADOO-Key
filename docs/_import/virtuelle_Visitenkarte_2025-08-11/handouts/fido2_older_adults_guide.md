# FIDO2 for Older Employees – Friendly Guide

Purpose: Make security keys easy and comfortable to use.

## What to expect
- A small key that plugs into your computer.
- When you see “touch your key”, gently press the gold circle.
- That’s it – fast and safe.

## Comfort tips
- Keep the key on a short lanyard or use a front USB port.
- If touching is awkward, ask IT for a USB‑A/USB‑C extender.
- Fingerprint is optional. If it’s difficult, ask IT to use touch‑only.

## If the key blinks red or asks for a PIN
- Enter your PIN when asked to unlock the key, then try again.
- If you forgot the PIN or it keeps failing, contact IT.

## If you misplace the key
- Let IT know. We can set up a backup key quickly.

## Privacy
- Your key protects your account without tracking you.
