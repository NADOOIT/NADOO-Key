# Paths & Configuration

Defaults:
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR = ~/Downloads`
- `EXTRACT_DIR = ~/Desktop/analytics_project/extracted`

`daily.py`:
- `BASE_EXTRACT_DIR` is currently a Windows path (`C:\\Users\\flori\\Desktop\\analytics_project\\extracted`). Update to your OS path.

Tips:
- Ensure both directories exist or let the scripts create them.
- If you use custom paths, change them consistently across scripts.
